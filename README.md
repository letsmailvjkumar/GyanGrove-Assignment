# Explanation of Design and Technical Decisions
API Integration: The project utilizes Axios to fetch event data from the provided APIs. Axios is a popular library for making HTTP requests, offering simplicity and flexibility.

Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction experience across various devices and screen sizes. This is achieved through the use of media queries and flexible layout techniques.

Lazy Loading: To optimize website load time and improve user experience, lazy loading techniques are implemented. This allows content, including images and other resources, to be loaded asynchronously as the user scrolls down the page.

Modular Functions: The codebase is structured with modular functions to enhance code readability, maintainability, and reusability. This approach promotes better organization and scalability of the project.
